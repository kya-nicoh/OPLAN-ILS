# OPLAN-ILS
A project that me and my classmates did when we were in 12th Grade. Credits to those who helped make this project possible.

## Notes
The project was to create a website for our local barangay. The goal was to create a working log-in system for both barangay admins and barangay residents. 
The website features monthly updates from the barangay. Fill-up forms to send requirements. Calendar of events. Repository for barangay officials, contact info and etc.
